# Twiddler

This is a simple Twitter clone built with jQuery. It is inspired by Twitter where users can post their own tweets and load new tweets of the others(auto-generated). Clicking the Update Feed button can re-render the currently displayed Feed with the most current list of Tweets. Clicking a friend's username inside an individual Tweet can re-render the Feed with the most current list of that specific user's Tweets. Clicking the Home Button can return to the Home Feed. Users can even see the time stamp of tweets.

## Project Specifications

## User Interface:
An app's User Interface is the visual space where interactions between a user and the application occur. It includes the HTML structure and the CSS styling of the app, but not necessarily the JavaScript functionality of the intended interactions.


## When our UX is complete, our users will be able to interact with the app by:

Clicking the Update Feed button to re-render the currently displayed Feed with the most current list of Tweets.
Clicking a friend's username inside an individual Tweet to re-render the Feed with the most current list of that specific user's Tweets.
Clicking the Home Button to return to the Home Feed.
