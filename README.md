# Twiddler

An app that resembles the function of Twitter where users can post their own tweets and load new tweetes of the others(auto-generated). Users can like, comment, retweet or share the tweets. They can even see the time stamp of tweets. Moreover, it is also possible to get a list view of each Tweet made by that specific user and go back to the home page afterwards.

## Project Specifications

## User Interface:
An app's User Interface is the visual space where interactions between a user and the application occur. It includes the HTML structure and the CSS styling of the app, but not necessarily the JavaScript functionality of the intended interactions.

When our UI is complete, our users will be able to see:

A Heading displaying the title of the application.
An Update Feed Button
Their Home Feed, with a list view displaying each of their friends' Tweets
Tweet Components, each identical in structure, complete with a:
Profile Photo
Username, with the format "@username"
Tweet Message
Human Readable Timestamp", like "2 minutes ago"
Set of Four Icons:
Comment
Retweet
Like
Share
An Individual User Feed, with a list view of each Tweet made by that specific user.
A Home Button, allowing the user to navigate back to the Home Feed.
User Experience
An app's User Experience encompasses all aspects of the user's interaction with the application, including the functionality of those interactions.

## When our UX is complete, our users will be able to interact with the app by:

Clicking the Update Feed button to re-render the currently displayed Feed with the most current list of Tweets.
Clicking a friend's username inside an individual Tweet to re-render the Feed with the most current list of that specific user's Tweets.
Clicking the Home Button to return to the Home Feed.
